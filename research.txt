### RATS RESEARCH 
Business/use case: incorporate more spatial features and processes while replying less on 311 data to determine likelihood of rat infestation on a given city block 
Environmental factors from DC Lab Report
•	Denser human population – units per buildings/block?
•	Poorly secured food waste 
•	Restaurants
•	Mix of residential and commercial zoning 
•	Water access 
•	Impervious surfaces
•	Community gardens
•	Alleyway conditions
•	Building conditions/vacancy
•	Older buildings
•	Sewer grates 
•	Construction -> permits 
•	Seasonal effects? (311 requests vary by season, but research from other cities suggest that rodent populations do not vary seasonally) 
  o	Milder winters, more warmer days -> more rats 

Additional variables to consider adding 
•	311 requests related to:
  o	missed trash pick-ups 
  o	alley clean up requests 
  o	Do we want to include 311 data at all?

•	Street usage level (assuming rats would stick to less busy roads/alleys?) : https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::roadway-functional-classification-1/explore?location=38.915389%2C-77.006631%2C14.92 
•	Illegal dumping 
•	Proximity to nearest rat sighting? -> would require 311 data
