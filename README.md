### Project Management
#### [Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nGroyO_JdxYuPIOrizUDo5iwkxVdH8Emu9CW2ZeOraM/edit?usp=sharing): schedule, tasks, datafile names, and contingency ideas 

### Weekly Updates 

### Week 1
#### Eric: 
Created Rmd file and loaded some libraries and multi-source data <br>
Some data wrangling work, checked the text mining logic, which is very sound and well-developed <br>
Checked that if event-based data is later than inspection dates, that canâ€™t be used

#### Henry:
Created polygons representing city blocks (geographically defined, as opposed to Census blocks) from DC's street centerlines dataset <br>
Joined rat inspection point-level dataset to city blocks to create potential unit of analysis <br>

#### Kate: 
Created project plan <br>
Added datafile legend <br>
Started contingency planning ideas <br>
Researched additional rats-related features and identified datasets <br>
