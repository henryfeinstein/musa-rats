### Project Management
#### [Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nGroyO_JdxYuPIOrizUDo5iwkxVdH8Emu9CW2ZeOraM/edit?usp=sharing): schedule, tasks, datafile names, and contingency ideas 

### Weekly Updates 
### Week 2 (1/24-1/30)
#### Eric: 
Explored original 311 report data, find 11 types of reports may be useful to our project, reclassified them into two categories: Trash issues and Infrastructure issues.<br>
Visualize the number of two types issues based on month, find that from June to September, trash issues number is obviously higher than any other months, which may be related to the high temperature, so we should take temperature into consideration.<br>
Visualize the distribution in DC of the two types issues.<br>


#### Henry:
Explored the spatial distribution of rat inspection and observation data at the city block and ward level<br>
Calculated new variables to examine distribution of inspections and rat evidence based on population and 311 call volume <br>
Created initial visualizations of major trends<br>

#### Kate: 
Built out exploratory analysis plan/tasks <br>
Identified datasets DC Lab used for environmental factors and imported updated points/polygons of these datesets <br>
Joined datasets to block data to find counts by our newly defined blocks <br>
Expored the spatial distribution of env variables and made visuals using new city blocks

### Weekly Tasks (Updated after class meeting)
### Week 2 (1/24 - 1/30) 
Henry - Exploratory analysis: 311 data -> rats by blocks, 311 requests by blocks, rat 311 requests by blocks, etc. <br>
Eric - Exploratory analysis: Look into 311 service types and relationships with rat infestation points  <br>
Kate - Exploratory analysis: Import previous data in points + Update project management plan <br>
All - make some visuals from your exploratory analysis and meet Monday (1/30) at 11:00 am on Zoom, plus think about hypotheses/assumptions and ways to account for seasonal changes.
